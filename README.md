# Audiofy

In the ever-evolving landscape of generative AI models, our journey with Audiofy began as a quest to bridge the gap in spatial audio generation. Witnessing the remarkable advancements in generative audio and music, we envisioned a novel approachâ€”empowering users to transform an image and a text prompt into an immersive Dolby 5.1 surround sound experience.

Audiofy is your creative companion. Provide an image of a scene paired with a text prompt, and watch as we craft a 10-second Dolby 5.1 surround sound clip that harmonizes seamlessly with your input. With a user-friendly interface, you can effortlessly download the final WAV file.
